#StepsToFollow for enjoying meeting


## WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO 

    + Describe what you would like to do and how ou intend to do it. 
    + Be clear about your intended outcomes and the approach you will use to produce those outcomes. 

## QUESTIONS

    + After you share your idea, find out what peoples are thinking. 
    + Start with an open - ended - question that allows them to express anything & everything 
      and gives them a chance to direct where the conversations goes. 
    + So you can ask 
      + What questions do you have ? 
      + is this clear ? Does it make sense ? 
    
    *Clarity is often a missing piece so by asking whether people are clear you provide them permission to say for whatever reasons they can't get behind what yoiu are saying*.
